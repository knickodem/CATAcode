**Principled Approaches to Coding Check-All-That-Apply Responses**

Check-all-that-apply (CATA) responses present methodological challenges
due to the large permutations of categories and the fluctuating salience
of intersecting responses across time and contexts. In particular,
accurately measuring, reporting, interpreting, and evaluating identity
categories in social science research is essential. These challenges can
hinder the validity of quantitative studies, especially those addressing
social identity differences.

`CATAcode` is designed to assist researchers in exploring CATA responses
for summary descriptives and and preparing CATA items for statistical
modeling. Applying this tool to cross-sectional and longitudinal data
can help enhance the generalizability, transparency, and reproducibility
of your research.

You can install the released version of `CATAcode` from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("CATAcode")
```

Or the development version from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("knickodem/CATAcode")
```

Once installed, load the package:

``` r
library(CATAcode)
```
