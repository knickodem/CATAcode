Description: Analyzing responses to check-all-that-apply survey items often requires 
    data transformations and subjective decisions for combining categories. 'CATAcode'
    contains tools for exploring response patterns, facilitating data transformations, 
    applying a set of decision rules for coding responses, and summarizing response frequencies.
